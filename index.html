                    <h3>1951</h3>
                    <p>One billionaire saw a struggle with the currect state for scientist who need resources, but struggle to recieve any funding. That's where the Free Access Laboritories come in.</p>
                    <p>Entablished in the 1950's, the F.A.L. lends money and a place to people of science to further the scientific research of the time to bring the future to you.</p>

                    <h3>1960</h3>
                    <p>The Facility started recieving funding from the government.</p>

                <div id="event">
                    <h3>1975</h3>
                    <p>The government threatened to cut its funding if The Facility did not meat its terms. They neaded to create something revolutionary to commercialize around the world by 1985. So, The Facility decided to start the research of portal technology.</p>

                    <h3>1979</h3>
                    <p>Artifical inteligence became a talking point within The Facility. A small startup was in progress and was later pitched to the CEO to expand on this technology to please the investors. The CEO agreed, but with other intentions.</p>

                <div id="event">
                    <h3>1982</h3>
                    <p>The governent cut its funding with The Facility early. The reason for this, is unknown. In responce, The Facility became a closed company and gave up on the portal project. Artificial intelligence was now the primary focus.</p>
                    <p>The current portal technology was unstable and shouldn't be used outside of The Facility.</p>

                    <h3>1986</h3>
                    <p>The Australis, an icebreaker ship that was initially designed to transport goods overseas, was now transfered to an initiative to transport heavy loads across the world using rumoured teleportation technology.</p>
                    <p>After running a few smaller tests, the Supervisor of the initiative rushed the main experiment causing the whole initiative to go wrong. The entire ship was gone, as well as three employees who were on the ship during the incident.</p>
                    <p>After the workers were annouced missing, any information regarding the initiative was intentionally lost to not get blamed, and the dockyard that originally contained everything regarding the initiative was sealed to never be seen again.</p>
                    <p>Some can still hear the horn of the Australis.</p>
